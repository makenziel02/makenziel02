## Hi there 👋

I'm Makenzie, a biology graduate with a strong passion and interest in working with complex data sets to further understand important biological quuestions relating to all things molecular biology, genetics, genomics, microbiology, and so on. I'm looking for opportunities to continue developing my bioinformatics and data science skills, as well as learn more about the field of computational biology as a whole.
